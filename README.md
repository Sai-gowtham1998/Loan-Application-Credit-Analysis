# Loan Application Credit Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing loan application data to predict creditworthiness using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation.

## Key Features:

1. **Imported File**: Loaded the loan application dataset for analysis.
2. **Checked for Null Values**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Scatter Plot**: Displayed a scatter plot between 'age' and 'Total Work Experience'.
   - **Box Plot**: Created box plots for 'age' and 'Cibil Score' to visualize their distributions.
4. **Feature and Target Creation**: Prepared the target and feature data for model training.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - Applied KNN classification to predict creditworthiness.
   - Created a KNN classifier and deployed the model.
   - **Testing Score**: 64%
   - **Training Score**: 67%
   - **Accuracy Score**: 64%
   - Evaluated training and testing scores for k values ranging from 1 to 14.
